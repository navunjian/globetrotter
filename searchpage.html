            <p>Fraser island is a place of exceptional beauty, with its long uninterrupted white beaches flanked by strikingly coloured sand cliffs, and over 100 freshwater lakes, some tea-coloured and others clear and blue all ringed by white sandy beaches. Ancient rainforests grow in sand along the banks of fast-flowing, crystal-clear creeks.Fraser Island is the only place in the world where tall rainforests are found growing on sand dunes at elevations of over 200 metres. The low "wallum" heaths on the island are of particular evolutionary and ecological significance, and provide magnificent wildflower displays in spring and summer. </p>

            <p>Langkawi, officially known as Langkawi the Jewel of Kedah (Malay: Langkawi Permata Kedah) is an archipelago of 104 islands in the Andaman Sea, some 30 km off the mainland coast of northwestern Malaysia. The islands are a part of the state of Kedah, which is adjacent to the Thai border. On July 15, 2008, Sultan Abdul Halim of Kedah had consented to the change of name to Langkawi Permata Kedah in conjunction with his Golden Jubilee Celebration. By far the largest of the islands is the eponymous Pulau Langkawi with a population of some 64,792, the only other inhabited island being nearby Pulau Tuba. Langkawi is also an administrative district with the town of Kuah as largest town. Langkawi is a duty-free island. </p>

            <p>The Caribbean’s most elite, most expensive island lives up to its reputation as an adult sandbox, where the rich and famous air-kiss over glasses of rosé. But it still has charms that make it attractive to regular folk, from its uncrowded white-sand beaches to its distinctly Gallic ﬂair. The tidy capital of Gustavia, with its gingerbread-trimmed cases (cottages) and designer shops, surrounds a yacht-ﬁlled harbor. On the opposite side of the island, near the airport, St.-Jean is a diminutive strip of colorful boutiques and beach bars that has been compared to St.-Tropez. Gorgeous, white-sand beaches—22, to be exact—are the trump card of St. Bart's, the Caribbean's most elite (read: most expensive) island. It's got a French vibe, gingerbread-style cottages in the pint-size capital of Gustavia, and the kind of sun great vacations are made of. </p>

We were delighted to find this museum uncrowded and geared to every level of learning. The boys spent a long hour in a mock up of the interior of a submarine while the older girls went with Dad through the holocaust exhibit in preparation for our visit to Germany later in the summer. The exhibits on the effects of WW2 on the country of England are phenomenal and of all of the amazing things we saw in London, this smaller museum ended up being one of the highlights of our city tour.</p>

            <p>For weeks before we arrived in the Netherlands we spent evenings in our tent reading The Diary of Anne Frank aloud. We wanted our kids to see the war through the eyes of a real child. Of course when we arrived in Amsterdam a visit to the house where she and her family lived out much of the war in hiding was on our short list of museums to visit. I dare you to visit this little home and come away without tears in your eyes. Snippets of her diary narrate the tour. Household items, a beautiful ceramic toilet, blacked out windows, all tell the story of a childhood lost. Our kids made a connection that day with a little girl who’d walked those halls as her cage, that they could never have made through the book alone.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>This children’s museum, housed in a 17th Century Jesuit College has an ever changing kaleidoscope of exhibits. When we first entered we wondered if we’d wasted our time and money. It’s very small, and our kids were borderline “too big” for it. Two hours later, while they were parading around in the costume of French royalty from the turn of the last century, we realized that this little space is a hidden gem in Marseille. If your kids are weary of having plaques read aloud and parading through one more castle or cathedral, take them here. Let them play their way through history, perhaps take up a crayon and have a turn at creating their own classic French art, and absorb the culture in their own way. It only gets a byline in a few of the guidebooks, but if you’ve got little people and you’re in Marseilles for a few days, ferret out this hole in the wall treasure!</p>

In Kentucky, we take pride in that, especially considering 95 percent of this corn-based, caramel colored sipping icon is distilled, aged and bottled right here in the state’s bourbon country. It’s big business for the Bluegrass State. But more than industry, bourbon is a culture, a history and heritage built by generations of Kentuckians from as early as the late 18th century. Today, you too can experience the culture of Kentucky bourbon country – hit the high points on a self-guided bourbon trail or just stop by your favorite distillery for a tour. Kentucky Bourbon Trail Take the legendary Kentucky Bourbon Trail through the heart of bourbon country and stop in on six of the state’s distilleries including Maker’s Mark, Jim Beam and Woodford Reserve. This trail allows you to tour bourbon country and experience the bourbon making process, view the facilities and amazingly beautiful surrounding landscapes, and stick around for an after-tour bourbon tasting. </p>
